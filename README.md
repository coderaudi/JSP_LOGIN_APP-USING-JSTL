# JSP_LOGIN_APP-USING-JSTL
this is the Dynamic web project which get the username and password inputs from the  login.jsp and send it for the validation after validating it create the new response and send to the browser but we are using the request Dispatcher it will get the request on the server site itself and send the response to the user with out changing  the acutal url . we are sending the user object insted of sending the data using the session or the appliation objects and from that user object we fetch the data and display to produce the dynamic result . we are using the JSTL because   in normal jsp file lot of java code is written by the coder it increase the complexity . to avoid that we use JSTL   JSTL is easy to use . ( we use jstl because the webdeveloper and the web designer are two different persons .
